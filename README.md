## Important notice

Classy Node is currently in development and is not ready for use on production.

## Installation

`npm install classy-node`

## Overview

Start by instantiating your `classy` instance. We recommend storing your client ID and client secret as environment variables.

```
var Classy = require('classy-node');

var classy = new Classy({
  clientId: process.env.CLIENT_ID,
  clientSecret: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET
});
```

Then, use `classy.app()` to obtain an application token and make calls as a trusted Classy application:

```
classy.app().then(function() {
  // Make calls on behalf of the application
});
```

In order to make calls on behalf of a member, you'll need a member token. After obtaining a member token, pass the member token into each request:

```
// Obtain a member token with a username and password
classy.oauth.auth({
  username: 'USERNAME_GOES_HERE',
  password: 'PASSWORD_GOES_HERE'
}).then((response) => {

  // Use member token for requests
  classy.organizations.createCampaign(1, {
    token: response.access_token
  });
});

// You can also obtain a member token with a refresh token
classy.oauth.auth({
  refreshToken: 'REFRESH_TOKEN_GOES_HERE'
});
```

Every resource method returns a promise:
```
classy.campaigns.retrieve(19, {
  token: 'app'
}).then(function(response) {
  // Do something with the response
}).catch(function(error) {
  // Do something with the error
});
```

Each resource can contain several basic methods (retrieve, update, delete). Each resource might also include additional custom methods that act upon related resources or perform specialized operations:

- `create()`
- `retrieve()`
- `update()`
- `del()`
- `create{RelatedResource}()` e.g., `createCampaign()`
- `list{RelatedResources}()` e.g. `listCampaigns()`
- Other/specialized e.g., `publish()`, `unpublish()`, & `deactivate()`

You can run our tests with `npm test` and get coverage reports with `npm run coverage`.

You can run the example with `babel-node example/index.js`. Make sure you have your environment variables for `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` set up!
